**Detailed description:**
Climatic fluctuation onlooker
There are apps and websites which show climatic changes and show us, all the required information but here, we have tried something very different on a large scale. We are creating a dashboard that shows statistics of climate change. Our dashboard will reflect the bar graphs and charts of different parameters which are responsible for climate change. Not only it will pass on the required information to the person but along it, it will raise awareness about how we all are playing a major role in climatic changes. The statistic is country-wise divided. Parameters like air pollution, electricity consumption, temperature change, ice melting, greenhouse gas emission.
Dashboard navigation will have these features to choose from:
Electricity Consumption
Air Index
Temperature Change Stats
Ice Coverage Stats
CO2 Stats
Indian State-wise Electricity Stats
Visitors can also filter data according to their wishes.
Not only it will show the statistics but also will provide solutions and tips for daily life. 
Apart from all this, in near future, we are planning to add a section where there would be a bundle of tips and information on smart living, living off-grid and how you could limit and reduce resource usage.
Moreover planning to add data for Catastrophic Events (floods, tornados, earthquakes, etc) and stats on garbage production.
Why we NEED a CLIMATE FLUCTUATION ONLOOKER (CFO)?
Currently, there is not any technology available that has the capability to reverse climate change. The only thing which can reverse the effect is the change in human practices, and to bring that change we want people to see the reality through data visualization. And this our application would be sufficient to do. Our application will help in making people realize the urgency for change.
One day counts and 365 one days make a year and the stat of a year is way large than of a day. So let us start by a day, less electricity consumption a day, less carbon emission a day, a pledge to save the climate by a day, and eventually, actions towards sustainability will rise, and then our stats will be lower.
